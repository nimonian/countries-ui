# Countries of the world

The only purpose is to provide a minimal demonstration of fetching data in a
React app.

To run it, you should

```bash
npm install
```

to install dependencies, and then

```bash
npm run dev
```

to run the app. You can then view it in the browser using the URL printed in
your console.

## Fetching data

The `src > App.jsx` contains comments in the code to explain what is happening
and why.

There are a few other files for css and whatnot but they aren't important -
`App.jsx` is where the fetching actually happens.
